    "I love building scalable software that not only works great but feels great to use. With experience across the development, Iâ€™ve worked with tools like C++, Python, Django, React.js, Next.js, and Spring Boot to turn ideas into real, functional products. Clean code, creative problem-solving, and constant learning are what keep me going.
